# midiMixer v1

Update: [Blog post.](https://notmy.space/projects/midimixerv1/)

This is the first properly documented incarnation of my project.
It originally started when I hand-wired a version of this, and assembled it in a 3D printed case.
It included a lot of very carefully measured and bent solid core 22AWG wire.
This essentially translates this circuit into a simple through-hole PCB, which allows easy soldering of headers for a Pro Micro, 4051 multiplexer, and 8 potentiometers.

The first model I assembled needed some printed clamps to go over the sides, because the potentiometers I used came from AliExpress, and the footprint I used in KiCAD was for a slightly different model.
The tabs used to solder the pot body to the PCB were slightly too large for the PCB holes.
As such, I simply clipped them off and bent them under to look clean, then forced the clamping pieces on to squash the pots against the PCB and tidy things up.

Ergonomics are not the best: the pots are too close together, and the rows are further apart than needed. However, it works, and is a fun little device.
